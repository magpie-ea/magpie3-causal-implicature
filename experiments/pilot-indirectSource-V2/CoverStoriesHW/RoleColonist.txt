You are one of the <strong>colonists</strong>, part of the group that has risked everything to settle on Xelifan-3 in search of a new beginning.
<br><br>
The colony’s survival is entirely dependent on a steady supply of <strong>Xeliherb</strong>, but its scarcity has led to a sense of urgency and tension. You live on the frontlines, working closely with the land, and every discovery you make has an immediate impact on the well-being of the people around you.
<br><br>
As a colonist, your mission is not just about survival but about the future of humanity’s presence on Xelifan-3. You must work alongside explorers and scientists to identify new Xeliherb patches, navigate the dangerous environments of the planet, and ensure the plant is yield and harvested efficiently.
<br><br>
However, there can be tension between the colonists and scientists. While the colonists focus on immediate survival, the scientists are driven by long-term research goals, which can lead to differing perspectives. Each group’s unique experiences and priorities may influence how they view and interpret information about <strong>Xeliherb</strong>.
<br><br>
<strong>Will you trust the scientists’ distant analysis, or will you rely on your own experiences and the stories shared by other colonists to guide your decisions?</strong>
