        Far into the future, humankind has started to populate deep space.
        A powerful herb, called <strong>Xeliherb</strong>, has become <strong>vital for human survival</strong> and technological advancement.
        However, Xeliherb <strong>grows only sparsely</strong> on some far-out planets, making survival in deep space a constant struggle.

        In the early days of deep space colonization, humans have relied on <strong>finding naturally growing Xeliherb</strong>.
        Dedicated <strong>Science Teams for Localization</strong> accumulated evidence for where to locate the precious, but fragile and hard-to-discover plant.

        While the discovery of naturally growing Xeliherb is still important, farmers have <strong>started successfully cultivating Xeliherb</strong> in controlled environments as well.
        Still, the herb proves difficult to cultivate, so that dedicated <strong>Science Teams for Cultivation</strong>  investigate how best to optimize the yield of Xeliherb farming.

        You are leading a farming station for cultivating Xeliherb.
        Your job is to decide how best to maximize the yield of Xeliherb in the next farming cycle.
        You are currently thinking about experimenting with additionally cultivating a small amount of other deep-space herbs together with Xeliherb, such as <strong>Diaxone or Ralocrop</strong>.
        Presently, this is a total shot in the dark.
        You have no evidence so far that this might be effective.
        The problem is that <strong>cultivating Diaxone or Ralocrop is very costly</strong> in terms of precious resources and may even reduce the yield of Xeliherb.
