<p>You are one of the <strong>scientist</strong>, part of an elite team tasked with uncovering the secrets of <strong>Xeliherb.</strong> The Xeliherb is not only a vital resource for the colony's survival, but it also represents a groundbreaking opportunity for scientific advancement. If its full potential can be unlocked, it could revolutionize medicine and become a powerful asset to humanity, well beyond the confines of Xelifan-3.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike the colonists, your mission is driven by discovery and innovation. You are going to conduct thorough research on Xeliherb, understanding its properties and developing new methods to maximize its yield. From your remote research stations or safe compounds, you receive data from the colonists and analyze the Xeliherb samples they send you. You must carefully interpret this information, using your scientific expertise to provide guidance on how to cultivate and harvest the plant more effectively.
<br><br>However, there can be tension between the colonists and scientists. While the colonists focus on immediate survival, the scientists are driven by long-term research goals, which can lead to differing perspectives. Each groupâ€™s unique experiences and priorities may influence how they view and interpret information about <strong>Xeliherb</strong>.
<br><br> <strong> Will you rely on the data and scientific methods you trust, or will you consider the colonists' on-the-ground experiences when advising on how to proceed?</strong>
