<p> <strong>Background:</strong> We are now at an age of great exploration and discovery. Humanity has reached the stars, venturing to distant planets in search of new frontiers and resources. One of these new worlds is a remote, resource-rich planet called <strong>Xelifan-3</strong></p>
          <p>The year is 2184, and Xelifan-3 has become home to a small but determined group of colonists. Their survival depends on a rare plant known as <strong>Xeliherb</strong>, a life-sustaining resource native to the planet. This unique plant has extraordinary properties, providing essential nutrients necessary for survival on the planet. Furthermore, it holds potential as a key ingredient in medicines capable of curing diseases, which has attracted significant interest from scientists around the galaxy. </p> 
          <p>However, xeliherb grows only <strong>sparsely</strong>, and its limited availability has made life on Xelifan-3 a constant struggle.</p>
